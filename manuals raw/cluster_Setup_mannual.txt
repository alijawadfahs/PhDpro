Step 1: Setting up the Screens: 

- create two screen to host Proxy-mity and serf: 
	- screen -SU Serf
	- screen -SU Proxy
- connect to the screen using the call screen -rU and the name of the screen. 

Step 2: Setting up a serf cluster using the .sh file: 

- connect to Serf screen using screen -rU Serf in all the nodes. 
- run the serf agent file at the master node inside the screen in the master node.
- then run the serf agent sh file in all the other nodes. they will join the master node. 
- serf members to check all the nodes are connected and they are displaying their Ip address of flannel. 

Step 3: Checking the serf Handlers: 

- check if all the nodes are replying correctly to handler service:
	- implement a test deployment in all the nodes (to initiate the cni interface). 
	- run the handler servicer from the hosting node (./handler.sh)
	- the outcome should show the number of requests of packets.
	- run a serf query and make sure all the nodes reply correctly.   

Step 4: Running Proxy-mity:
- start by creating and exposing a deployment. 
- excute in all the nodes:
	sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i cni0 -j ACCEPT
	sudo iptables -A FORWARD -o cni0 -j ACCEPT
- make sure that the service ip is working on all the nodes. 
- inside the Proxy screen (screen -rU Proxy):
	cd FOG-aware
	./main.py --LoadBalancing 'e(-x)' --alpha 1 --cycle 60

Step 5: Test the SVC handler: 
- make sure it's installed and running in all the nodes. 

Step 6: change the delay using TC and the programmed automation. 

- in the delay folder check the delay.csv mapping and then run ./create.py
- this will create the sh file for the tc commands to be ran in each node. 
- chmod of the file in the newely configured nodes to exe. 
- ./run.sh and everything will be excuted automatically. 


Step 7: run Hona and make sure everything is running. 

- create and expose a deployment. 
- make sure that the svc query is responding on all the nodes. 
- Start sending the load on the test deployment by changing the svc ip in the test sh file and running it
- make sure that the check function running is upgrading the new transmitted packets. 
- using the schd Run function to deploy a new deployment
- see the detection of the deployment on the check code. 
- change the svc IP and send a new load to these nodes 

Step 8: run the load injection software.
